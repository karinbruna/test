                Born January 5, 1941 in Bunkyō ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined 
                Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with 
                director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond 
                the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to 
                A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon 
                Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy 
                Conan. He joined Telecom Animation Film/Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro 
                in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1984, as well as the television series Sherlock Hound.

                Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky (1986), 
                My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). The films were met with critical and commercial 
                success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film ever to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of 
                the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997;[a] its distribution to the Western 
                world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing 
                film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked 
                among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)—also 
                enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, 
                though he returned to work on a new feature film in 2016.
