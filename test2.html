            <p>
             The name Ghibli was given by Hayao Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli, based on the Libyan-Arabic name for the hot desert 
             wind of that country, the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".[4][5] It also refers to 
             an Italian aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli. Although the Italian word is more accurately transliterated as ギブリ (Giburi), 
             the Japanese name of the studio is ジブリ (Jiburi).[4]

            Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior 
            to the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation 
            and had worked together on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun in 1968 and the Panda! Go, Panda! films in 1972 
            and 1973, and in 1978, Suzuki became an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga magazine, where the first film he chose was 
            Horus. A year after his phone call with Takahata and his first encounter with Miyazaki, both about Horus, he made a phone call 
            about the first film Miyazaki ever directed: The Castle of Cagliostro.

            <p>
            In Japan, the company's films are distributed by Toho theatrically (Except for Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service, 
            which were distributed by Toei Company, and My Neighbors the Yamadas, which was distributed by Shochiku), and by Walt Disney 
            Studios Japan on home media along with The Castle of Cagliostro and Mary and the Witch's Flower.[32] Before the Disney deal, 
            Tokuma Shoten released Ghibli movies themselves through their "Animage Video" imprint, as well as all Laserdisc releases of 
            the movies, as the Disney deal didn't include that format.
